If you have multiple dice of the same type (same number of sides), you don't have to compute the average 
of each one and then add them together. That would be wasting a lot of CPU cycles. 
Instead, just calculate the average of a single one of the dice and multiply it by the number of dice you have.

That should simplify your code a little bit too. If you were already doing this, great job! I just thought
I'd make it a hint in case you felt like there was an easier way but hadn't figured it out yet.
