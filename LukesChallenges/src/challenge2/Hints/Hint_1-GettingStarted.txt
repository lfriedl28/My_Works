In order to compute the average of multiple dice,
you'll first need to compute the average of a single die.

You may want to create a function for this.
A basic outline for something like that would look like this:

public double getAverageOfSingleDice(int numberOfSides){

	double average = 0.0;
	
	//Logic that computes the average goes here
	
	return average;
}
