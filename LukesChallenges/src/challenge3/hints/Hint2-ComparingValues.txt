Comparing values can be a little tricky. Most primitive data types have a "compareTo" method.
You'll be writing something similar to it. The EASIEST way to do this is to make a method that takes in 2 pizza types, like so:

public int comparePizzas(Pizza p1, Pizza p2) {

}

You might've noticed that the return value for this method is an integer? That's correct. In the compareTo method, your logic should
return an integer. 
		If p1.getPricePerSquareInch() is larger than p2.getPricePerSquareInch() the integer you return should be a positive value.
		If p1.getPricePerSquareInch() is smaller than p2.getPricePerSqureInch() the integer you return should be a negative value.
		If p1.getPricePerSquareInch() and p2.getPricePerSquareInch() are equal, the integer you return should be 0.
		
	Bonus points if you figure out a clean way to do this in one line of code.
